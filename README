namcap-reports is a automated report generator for the Archlinux
source distribution (PKGBUILDs). It uses the output of namcap and the
power of python to churn out HTML.

Dependencies: python>=2.5, make, bash, abs, namcap

Here's how the thing works:
* namcap is run against the entire ABS tree (would be better to make
  this run against a latest svn/cvs checkout) and a namcap.log is created.
* gen-pkglist-by-repository churns out three files: core, extra and community
  containing a list of packages in the respective repositories. On an Arch
  system, this can be easily done using pacman -Slq core >| core etc. but
  since namcap-reports is currently running on a Mac, I needed to write
  this script as a workaround.
* namcap-report.py takes the namcap.log plus these three repository listings
  and generates the output (both the html and rss).

The maintainer report generation works as follows:
* First a maintainers.txt file is created in the same directory as the
  code; this is basically the output of parsing the PKGBUILDs and
  printing out the "# Maintainer: " lines along with the $pkgname.
* Then maintainer-report.py runs and generates the output, by
  default in the "maintainer/" directory.

CONFIGURATION

There's a configuration file for namcap-report now; either
/etc/namcap-reports.conf or $HOME/.namcap-reports.conf which has the
format as given in namcap-reports.conf.example

[namcap-reports]
url: http://abhidg.mine.nu/arch/namcap-reports
output_dir: /arch/namcap-reports
template_dir: /arch/namcap-reports
repo_files: /arch/namcap-reports

output_dir is the most important one, that's where namcap-report and
maintainer-report place the generated files (maintainer-report actually
puts everything in a maintainer/ subdirectory of the output_dir directory).

url is the base url for the RSS feeds and template_dir is the directory
where the index.html.tmpl and tags.html.tmpl files are stored (These are
the files which namcap-report uses to prepare the output). repo_files is
the directory where the package listings core, extra and community are
present.

A sample Makefile is also there. Currently a copy of namcap.log has to
present in the same directory where the code is, but it is easy to fix
that.

LOGS

namcap-report and maintainer-report store the error logs in
namcap-report-error.log and maintainer-report-error.log respectively.
At the start of each run, these error logs are *deleted*, so be sure to
keep a copy if you need to reference the logs at a later time. If you
give the verbose (-v) switch to them on the command line, the errors are
also printed to screen.

namcap-report generates another log: namcap-report-progress.log, which
has the total number of errors and warnings over time. This can be useful
later, for example for drawing nice graphs :)
